**About this document**

This document describes how to connect a Synap IoT Sensor to Microsoft Azure IoT Hub

-   Configuring Microsoft Azure IoT Hub
-   Install your Synap IoT Sensor
-   Registering your Synap IoT Sensor Device in Microsoft Azure IoT Hub
-   Start collecting Sensor Data

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   {enter your device name here} device.

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Unbox the sensor and connect the power cord
-   Use a Smart Phone to scan WiFi networks and connect to the Synap IoT Sensor. The WiFi name is Synap-<serial number>. The Serial number is located on the Sensor and on the packaging.
-   Connect to Synap IoT Sensor to the WiFi you want to Sensor to use.
-   Obtain the Sensors IP address by searching for the Mac address of the sensor. You can look at your DHCP Server or use arp -A and fin the Mac address and the corresponding IP address. The Sensors MAC address is located on the Sensor and on the packaging.

# Step 3: Setup the Sensor

-   Open a Browser and enter the IP address of the sensor.
-   In your browser, click on the Sensor Settings tab.
-   Enter a Friendly Name for the sensor.
-   Enter the interval in Seconds that the sensor will use between each Data transmission to Azure IoT Hub.
-   Enter in which timezone the Sensor is located. Enter the number of hours from GMT. Example: New York, USA = -5 and Bangkok, Thailand = 7.
-   Enter Sensor Type. The Sensor Type is shown in the Device Twin in the IoT Hub, so it could be for example: Thermometer, Flow Sensor, Cryogen Freezer etc.
-   Enter Sensor Location. This will also be shown in the Device Twin. Example: Building 2, Office 6.
-   Enter Sensor Telemetry Data. This is shown in the Device Twin, and is a meant as a what measuring unit the data is in. It could be: Meter, Liter/per, Degree Celcius, Kg, Distance in cm etc.
-   Click on Save.

-   Now click on the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub Settings tab
-   Copy your Primary and Secondary Connection String from the Device in your Azure IoT Hub and paste them here.
-   Click on Save and then Restart
